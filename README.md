# Hello there, weary crustacean traveler! ðŸ¦€
### You may rest here safely for a while, before moving on your next coding adventure. <br /> I am an experienced C++ and Rust software developer based on Tel Aviv. <br/> The chicken in my profile picture is my cat Poof.

### About me
I am mostly interested in robotics and game development, I have always loved software engineering and I love learning new stuff. \
I am experienced with all of the stages of software development from design, coding, testing, all the way to continous integration and client deployment.

I am currently working in a company called FalkorDB, which develops the titular database,
that is in fact the [The world's fastest graph database](https://www.falkordb.com/), \
I recommend you check that out.

In my spare time I play rugby 7's, and am a musician, I mostly play the bass.

### Github projects
+ [`mapping-rs ðŸ¦€ (Click me!)`](https://github.com/EmilyMatt/mapping-rs) - An open source software ecosystem, meant to speed up \
    bootstrapping your Rust robotics projects, includes various computational algebra and spatial recognition algorithms, \
    that run blazingly fast, written in pure Rust. \
    This project is still in its early stages, but after a short break I am once again actively working on it. \
    For my 1.0 release I intend to have a fully functional Hector SLAM suite, and a few other goodies. \
    Currently, the connecting suite is not yet implemented, but the various algorithms used to construct it are there and ready to go! \
    You can fully use the `mapping-algorithms` crate itself, even without the `mapping-suites` crate.
